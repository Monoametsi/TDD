<h1> Test Driven Development Task</h1>

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>This is a project that was built with the purpose of giving a small demonstration of test driven development with the jest testing framework. It tests for the success and failure of basic mathematical calculations such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, power of and the square root of. 
The technologies used to put it together consists of NodeJS and Typescript.<p>

<h1>Understanding test driven development</h1>
<p>TDD(Test driven development) is a technique or process for developing software. The goal is to maintain a high quality of code and to keep the developer who writes the code productive, even as a projects grows in size and complexity. TDD follows the red-green-refractor loop. The red-green-refractor loop is a process that consists of first intentionally writing a test to fail, then secondly writing just enough code that will pass the failing test, then lastly critiquing the code design and refractoring the code whcih will help in keeping tests intact.</p>
